## Why Angular 2 and why TypeScript?

#### Angular 2
Angular 2 is the next version of Gooles MV* framework for building webb apps. It was announced in October 2014. It embraces futher feb standars as ES6 and dom shadowing. They even say that its 5 times faster than its precursor.
Angular 2 is still in beta, but it looks very promissing i have to say. At least for me :)

#### TypeScript 2
Why TypeScript?? Why not pure js?  Mainly because Angular 2 is quite new and the tutorials out there are for just TypeScript. 
In the end , for me as a developer TypeScript provides me a typed superset of JavaScript.
Existing JavaScript projects can be converted to TypeScript "simply" by renaming the source files from*.js to *.ts.

The TypeScript code here get transpiled into JavaScript with the typescript tool configured as a file watcher.
